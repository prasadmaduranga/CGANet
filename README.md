# CGANet 
Generative Adverserial Network (GAN) based machine learning model for removing rain streaks from images. Implementation is based on the image translation framework proposed by Isola in Pix2Pix. [https://phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/]


# Required Modules
Python 3
Tensorflow 2.0


# Getting Started
Given Jupyter notebook covers the python implementation of the algorithm, that can be used for training and testing of the image deraining. Image files inside Data folder can be used for training and validation of the model.
